 * event can be triggered per audio chunk. This puts a limit on the
 * number of notes per second an instrument can play, which is the
 * number of audio chunks per second * the polyphony.
 * For 6 voices and 64 sample chunks this amounts to a maximum of 4000
 * notes per second. Which should be still be enough for all but the
 * most absurd Black Midi compositions.
