# Misc folder - example configurations

This folder contains some example JSON config files for Sushi, and some data (e.g. audio files) to run them.

Not all the config files will work for every Sushi configuration, for example the multichannel or CV examples will require you to have enough I/O available. Their purpose is to cover most basic use cases that you could encounter.

You might need to change the absolute paths in some config files to make them work, e.g. the soundfile path in `play_brickworks_fx.json` or the plugin path in `play_vst2.json`.
