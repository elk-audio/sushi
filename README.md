# SUSHI
Headless plugin host for ELK Audio OS.

## Usage
See `sushi -h` for a complete list of options.
Common use cases are:

Test in offline mode with I/O from audio file:

    $ sushi -o -i input_file.wav -c config_file.json

Use Coreaudio on macOS for realtime audio, with the default devices:

    $ sushi --coreaudio -c config_file.json

Use JACK for realtime audio:

    $ sushi -j -c config_file.json

With JACK, Sushi creates 8 virtual input and output ports that you can connect to other programs or system outputs.

## Sushi macOS
Since version 1.0, Sushi can be built natively for macOS as a native binary with all the dependencies statically linked to it.

There is a new Coreaudio frontend (selectable with the `--coreaudio` command-line option) to interface directly with Coreaudio. As an alternative, a Portaudio frontend is also available (with the `--portaudio` flag).

With Coreaudio, you can select other devices than the default with the `--audio-input-device-uid` and `--audio-output-device-uid` options. To find out the right number there, you can launch Sushi with the `--dump-portaudio-devs` to get a list in JSON format printed to stdout.

MIDI support is provided through RtMidi and can access directly CoreMidi devices.

LV2 support is currently not available for macOS.


## Example Sushi configuration files in repository
Under `misc/config_files` in this repository, we have a large variety of example Sushi configuration files.

The first one to try to check if everything is running properly, would be this one that uses the internal sequencer & synthesizer to generate a sequence:
```
$ ./sushi --coreaudio -c config_files/play_brickworks_synth.json
```
(on Linux with JACK, replace `--coreaudio` with `--jack`).

Many of the examples use the mda-vst3 plugins which are built when building Sushi. If you are running one of the prebuilt packages (available on the releases sections on Github), you have everything inside the `sushi` folder there. For example, on macOS you should be able to get a simple working synthesizer with:

Otherwise, if you are building from source, the plugins used by the examples can be found under:

`build/debug/VST3/Debug`, or `build/release/VST3/Release` respectively, for debug and release builds.

To run Sushi with an example configuration, you simply invoke it while pointing to one of the above paths.

On Ubuntu that could be:
```
$ ./sushi -j -c ../../misc/config_files/play_vst3.json --base-plugin-path VST3/Debug
```

Or, from a macOS terminal:
```
$ ./sushi --coreaudio -c ../../misc/config_files/play_vst3.json --base-plugin-path VST3/Release
```

## Extra documentation
Configuration files are used for global host configs, track and plugins configuration, MIDI routing and mapping, events sequencing.

More in-depth documentation is available at the [Elk Audio OS official docs page](https://elk-audio.github.io/elk-docs/html/sushi/index.html).

## Building
Sushi builds are supported for native Linux systems, Yocto/OE cross-compiling toolchains targeting Elk Audio OS systems, and macOS.

Make sure that Sushi is cloned with the `--recursive` flag to fetch all required submodules for building. Alternatively run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.

Sushi requires a compiler with support for C++17 features. The recommended compilers are GCC version 10 or higher, and clang version 13 or higher.

### Native Linux dependencies
Sushi handles most dependencies with vcpkg (or as submodules) and will build and link with them automatically. A few dependencies are not included however and must be provided or installed system-wide. See the list below (debian packages names):

  * libasound2-dev

  * libjack-jackd2-dev

  * For VST 2:
      * Vst 2.4 SDK - Needs to be provided externally as it is not available from Steinberg anymore.

  * For LV2:
      * liblilv-dev - at least version 0.24.4. Lilv is an official wrapper for LV2.
      * lilv-utils - at least version 0.24.5.
      * lv2-dev - at least version 1.18.2. The main LV2 library.

        The official Ubuntu repositories do not have these latest versions at the time of writing. The best source for them is instead the [KX Studio repositories, which you need to enable manually](https://kx.studio/Repositories).

      * For LV2 unit tests:
          * lv2-examples - at least version 1.18.2.
          * mda-lv2 - at least version 1.2.4 of [drobilla's port](http://drobilla.net/software/mda-lv2/) - not that from Mod Devices or others.

### Building with vcpkg (native Linux & macOS)
Instructions:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build 
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../third-party/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
```

This might take some time for the first build since all the vcpkg dependencies will have to be built first.


### Building with Yocto for Elk Audio OS
Sushi can be built either with the provided [Elk Audio OS SDK](https://github.com/elk-audio/elkpi-sdk), or as part of a [full Elk Audio OS image build with bitbake](https://github.com/elk-audio/elk-audio-os-builder).

Follow the instructions in those repositories to set up a cross-compiling SDK and build Sushi for a given target.

The default values for the options are platform-specific (native Linux, Yocto/OE, macOS).

_Note_:

before version 1.0, the Cmake options didn't have the `SUSHI_` prefix. The old names (e.g. `WITH_JACK`) are not supported anymore and should be changed to the new format.

## Running Unit tests separately
Some Sushi's unit tests depend on test data, which is found through the environment variable `SUSHI_TEST_DATA_DIR`.
You will need to define this if you want to run the unit test explicitly, e.g. while debugging:

`$ export SUSHI_TEST_DATA_DIR=/path/to/sushi/repo/test/data`
