# Contributing to Elk Audio OS

## Github Issues

You can open a Github issue to signal a bug or request a new feature. Please don't create an issue to ask about general help, use the [Elk Audio Forum](https://forum.elk.audio) for generic questions and assistance.

When writing a bug report, try to be as complete as you can regarding the context:
  * Mention the version of Elk Audio OS that you are testing
  * What is your run-time setup (plugins, buffer size, audio/CV channels, sensors, etc.)
  * (if working on a plugin) what is your build environment
  * If the issue is about SUSHI, TWINE or a plugin, try to reproduce it with the SUSHI AppImage for Linux or using another audio frontend (offline, dummy)
  * Include relevant files that helps understand your issue or, better, to reproduce it
