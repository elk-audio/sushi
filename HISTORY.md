  * Track channel config has been simplified. The json "mode" member has been replaced with an integer "channels" member. To create a multibus track, an additional member "multibus" must be set to true and the number of buses specified with the "buses" member.
  * Tracks now only report number of channels (and buses in the multibus case) and input and output channels and busses are assumed to be the same.
  * All instances of "busses" in json config and grpc api has been corrected to "buses"
