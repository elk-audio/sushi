#Licensing information

All SUSHI code is Copyright © 2017-2019 [Modern Ancient Instruments Networked] (“Elk”) and is licensed under the [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html](GNU Affero General Public License v.3) (“AGPLv3”). Such SUSHI code is considered the “Program” within the meaning of the AGPLv3.

Loading plugins or libraries into the Program, or statically or dynamically linking or interfacing other applications, plugins, or libraries with the Program, including through a network API, is making a combined work based on the Program. Thus, the AGPLv3 covers the entire combination. You may therefore propagate, convey, or make available over a network, this combined work only in full compliance with the AGPLv3, including compliance with the obligation to provide the Corresponding Source (as that term is defined and used in the AGPLv3) for this entire combination.

As a special exception, Elk gives you permission to combine the Program with plugins, libraries or applications that are either:

 * made available by you under the GNU General Public License v2 or v3, or the GNU Lesser General Public License v2 or v3; or

 * made available by you without charge or royalty under other open source or proprietary terms, regardless of whether such terms conflict or are incompatible with the AGPLv3, but only if you make available to any requesting party the Corresponding Source of such plugins, libraries, or applications without charge under license terms that permit commercial royalty-free use, modification and distribution.

This exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the AGPLv3.
